# Desktop Todo

This is an Alfred Workflow inspired by an [@holman's idea](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/commit/d774e970a88a04aca8024178849301af6d6ac5c3):

> All `todo` does is put a file on my Desktop with the filename given. That's it. I aggressively prune my desktop of old tasks and keep one or two on there at a time. Once I've finished a todo, I just delete the file. That's it.

Desktop Todo allow you to create/delete empty items on your desktop from Alfred. That's it.

## Usage

### Create a todo

`t my todo item` will create an empty `my todo item` file on `~/Desktop`.

### Delete a todo

`d ` will list you files without extension (assumed as todo items) from `~/Desktop`.
